In the latter half of the\n20th century, the concept of a “mature minor” was developed.10 Developmental research conducted in the 1980s found\nthat many minors reach the level of cognitive development that allows for abstract thinking and complex decision\nmaking by mid-adolescence. Indeed, research demonstrates that by age 14 and 15, adolescents have the capacity to\nmake health-related decisions similar to those of adults.11\nThere is no universal agreement among medical organizations that de:ne the age of competence in decision making in\nadolescent health matters.",

Bleeding disorders work up should be performed in those with suggestive histories.\nMenstrual blood loss is the most common cause of iron deficiency in adolescents, with or without anemia.\nProviders should correct anemia and iron deficiency and be aware that the latter may require a longer\ntreatment course.\nTreatment of HMB in adolescents should be guided by the principle of patient centered care. Treatment\noptions are both medical and non-medical. Medical treatments can be hormonal and nonhormonal.\nGlobal and individual efforts should be targeted to address the root causes and possible solutions for the\npublic health concern, that is period poverty.",
