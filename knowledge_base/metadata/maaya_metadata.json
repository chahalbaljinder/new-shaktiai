The ability of the fetus to successfully\nnegotiate the pelvis during labor and delivery depends on the complex interactions of four variables: uterine activity, the\nfetus, the maternal pelvis and maternal wellbeing.

Most of all\nit is important to look at labor progress in a holistic fashion with an awareness of all the factors involved and full\nconsideration of them especially when making a diagnosis of labor dystocia. \nPRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS\nLabor is conventionally defined by three stages. The first stage is the progressive dilatation to 10 cm (fully).\nThe second stage is from full dilatation to birth. The third stage is from birth of the baby to expulsion of the\nplacenta. A fourth stage is sometimes identified and refers to the immediate postpartum period after\nexpulsion of the placenta.",
