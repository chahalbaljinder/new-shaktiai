### **Technical Implementation:**

```python
# Real-time listening loop
while voice_active:
    # Listen for 4-second chunks
    audio = recognizer.listen(source, timeout=1, phrase_time_limit=4)
    
    # Immediate transcription
    partial_text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
    
    # Enhance medical terms
    enhanced_text = enhance_medical_context(partial_text)
    
    # Update UI in real-time
    st.session_state['current_transcript'] = accumulated_text
    
    # Auto-submit after 3 silences
    if silence_count >= 3:
        trigger_auto_submit()
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Optimized for Interactive Use:**

```python
recognizer.energy_threshold = 300      # Lower for responsiveness  
recognizer.pause_threshold = 1.5       # Longer before ending
recognizer.phrase_threshold = 0.2      # Faster initial response
```
