# PostgreSQL Wishes Vault - Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Database Backend**: PostgreSQL integration is complete
2. **Secure Storage**: Wishes are now encrypted and stored in PostgreSQL
3. **Enhanced Features**: Contact management, sharing history, and better UI
4. **Migration**: Seamlessly replaced file-based storage with database

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install PostgreSQL
```bash
# Windows: Download from https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
# Install with default settings and remember the postgres user password
```

### 2. Create Database
```cmd
createdb -U postgres shakti_ai_db
```

### 3. Configure Environment
Edit the `.env` file with your PostgreSQL password:
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=shakti_ai_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password_here
DB_PORT=5432
```

### 4. Test Connection
```bash
python test_db_connection.py
```

### 5. Run SHAKTI-AI
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `wishes_vault_db.py` - New PostgreSQL-backed wishes vault
- `db_config.py` - Database configuration and connection management
- `setup_database.py` - Database setup utility with GUI
- `quick_db_setup.py` - Quick setup script
- `test_db_connection.py` - Connection test utility
- `.env` - Environment configuration

### Modified Files:
- `app.py` - Updated to use new wishes vault
- `requirements.txt` - Added PostgreSQL dependencies

## 🔧 Database Schema

### Tables Created:
1. **wishes** - Main wishes storage
   - Encrypted content
   - Contact information
   - Sharing preferences
   - Timestamps

2. **sharing_history** - Track sharing activity
   - When wishes were shared
   - With whom and how
   - Status tracking

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Encryption**: All wishes content is encrypted using Fernet
- **Secure Storage**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- **Privacy**: No sharing data stored permanently
- **Access Control**: User-based data isolation

## 🔄 Migration from File-Based

The system automatically handles the transition:
- Old file-based wishes can be manually imported
- New database structure is more robust
- Better error handling and recovery

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Connection Failed**: Check PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct
2. **Import Error**: Ensure `psycopg2-binary` is installed
3. **Permission Error**: Run database creation as administrator
4. **Encoding Issues**: Ensure your .env file is saved as UTF-8

### Support Commands:
```bash
# Test database connection
python test_db_connection.py

# Setup database with GUI
streamlit run setup_database.py

# Check PostgreSQL status (Windows)
net start postgresql-x64-14
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Edit `.env` with your PostgreSQL password
2. Run `python test_db_connection.py` to verify connection
3. Launch SHAKTI-AI: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Test the wishes vault functionality
5. Enjoy the enhanced, secure wishes management!
