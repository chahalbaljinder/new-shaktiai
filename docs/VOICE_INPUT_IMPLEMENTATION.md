# Voice Input Implementation in Knowledge Base

## Overview
Successfully implemented voice input functionality in the SHAKTI-AI Knowledge Base component, allowing users to speak their questions directly to AI experts.

## Features Implemented

### Frontend (React/Next.js)
1. **Voice Recording Interface**
   - Microphone button with visual states (idle, recording, processing)
   - Real-time recording indicator with stop/process option
   - Smart microphone permissions handling
   - Browser compatibility checks for MediaRecorder API

2. **User Experience**
   - Visual tip about voice input availability
   - Dynamic placeholder text during recording
   - Validation to ensure experts are selected before voice input
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Animated recording indicator

3. **Audio Recording**
   - MediaRecorder API integration
   - Multiple audio format support (WAV, WebM, MP4, OGG)
   - Automatic format selection based on browser support
   - Proper cleanup of audio streams and resources

### Backend (FastAPI/Python)
1. **Speech-to-Text Processing**
   - Multi-format audio file support
   - Automatic audio format conversion using pydub
   - Google Speech Recognition integration
   - Robust error handling with fallback strategies

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of unrecognizable audio
   - Network error management
   - File format conversion fallbacks
   - Proper temporary file cleanup

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Flow
1. User clicks microphone → Permission request
2. MediaRecorder starts → Visual feedback shown
3. User speaks → Audio data collected
4. User stops → Audio blob created and uploaded
5. Backend processes → Speech-to-text conversion
6. Text returned → Automatically added to input field
7. User can edit/send → Normal chat flow continues

### Code Components
- **Frontend**: `components/KnowledgeBase.tsx` - Voice UI and recording logic
- **Backend**: `backend_service.py` - Speech-to-text API endpoint
- **API Client**: `lib/api/client.ts` - Voice API integration
- **Hooks**: `lib/api/hooks.ts` - React Query voice hooks

### Browser Support
- Chrome/Edge: Full WebM support
- Firefox: WebM/OGG support
- Safari: Limited support (may require different approach)
- Fallback: Manual text input always available

## Dependencies Added
- **Frontend**: Already had necessary APIs (MediaRecorder, getUserMedia)
- **Backend**: Added `pydub` for audio format conversion
- **Existing**: SpeechRecognition library already installed

## Voice Input Workflow
1. **Preparation**: Select at least one AI expert
2. **Start Recording**: Click microphone button (turns red and pulses)
3. **Speak Clearly**: Voice prompt appears, speak your question
4. **Stop Recording**: Click microphone again or use "Stop & Process" button
5. **Processing**: "Processing voice input..." indicator shows
6. **Result**: Transcribed text appears in input field
7. **Send**: Edit if needed, then send to selected experts

## Error Scenarios Handled
- Microphone not available
- Microphone permission denied
- No audio detected
- Speech not recognizable
- Network connection issues
- Unsupported browser features

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time speech-to-text streaming
- Voice commands for agent selection
- Multi-language speech recognition
- Voice response playback (text-to-speech)
- Voice shortcuts for common questions

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to Knowledge Base in SHAKTI-AI app
2. Select one or more AI experts
3. Click the microphone button (should turn red)
4. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
5. Speak a clear question (e.g., "What are the symptoms of anemia?")
6. Click microphone again to stop recording
7. Wait for processing (should see transcribed text)
8. Send the message to chat with experts

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Voice input is now fully functional in the Knowledge Base, providing an accessible and intuitive way for users to interact with SHAKTI-AI's expert system through speech.
